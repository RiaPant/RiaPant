  Many, Many Happy returns of the day.<br>
  May you have a long long life.<br>
  And also, a successful one.<br>
  And also, may you are able to gain some weight in the near future. Please be a little fat, just a little. Pleaaaasee! You have become all the more thin.<br>  <br>
  Also, congratulations, for turning 21! Yeah, You can laugh at this. I am congratulating you for turning <b>21</b> in your typical expressions... BUT BUDHI ho toh gye ho AAP. *SMirkiNg* {Please dont read this as smoking, okay?} <br>
  
  So finally, after listening to the <i>Happy Birthday Song!! and cracking the pwd</i>  you are here.Phewwwww Kaafi brain Gym hogya... LOL!<br>
  Also, You know how creative I am, like award winning creativity...hehehe, hence this.<br>
  
  I hope you do like the efforts. It surely did take some time. Nevertheless, I have got another html/css project on my resume? <i>Do you thing I should be adding this on my LinkedIN?</i> Hahaha...<br> So, now besides, Viral Times, I'll have another fully function webpage. HAHAHA<br>

  So, it has been like a realllllllllllyyyyyy long journey. The first friend, I made on the very first day. I really did wonder how come somebody can speak so much without even knowing me?? Hahaha...<br>
  But thats pretty much not you fault. My mental state is to be blamed! Lol! Thanks for bearing with me, in the initial days. I know you still try and do.Hahaha. But thanks for sticking up, like always up! <br>
  With you I have had many <b>Firstsss</b>.<br>
  The first party I attended in such a shady place.<br>

  <img src="5.jpg" style="margin-left: 25%;margin-top: 2%;border-radius: 25px; height: 50%;width: 50%"><br><br>
 Now I actually cannot imagine going to a party without you :) And this is going to be the third bday of yours, that we are together. People havebeen added, deleted, but we have remained glued.<br>
 <b> FROM the 19 Jan 2015:<br></b>
  <img src="10.jpg" style="margin-left: 25%;margin-top: 2%;border-radius: 25px; height: 50%;width: 50%"><br><br>
  <b>to the 19 Jan 2016: Double the number of people<br></b>
<img src="3.jpg" style="margin-left: 30%;margin-top: 2%;border-radius: 25px; height: 40%;width: 40%"><br><br>
  AND now to 2017: <br>

  It has been a great journey so far, with not so many ups and downs. Yeah! We pretty much have been together always. You have been a great friend in many aspects. I wont say that things have been the same since the beginning. <br><i>But things dont always remain the same too.<br> But friendships definitely do.<br> And I'll be there for you {Please note the rhymes}.<br></i>
  This goes unsaid. You can always bank upon me, no matter <b>I come online on whatsapp or not</b>, no matter you find me <b>Well-groomed or not!!</b><br>
  But I'll be there. And I hope you do toooo!! 
  I remember you telling me, on 19th Jan 2016, for a card. I am sorry. I was upset at you. I wasnot after wards. But yes I was then, on some realllllllly stupid thing. You'll laugh when, I'll tell you.So no point. I wish I could turn back time. And do the same.<br>
  So this time its a whole html login page enabled greeting. I hope you do consider my efforts. Please do!!

 Aur haan! I remember my bridesmaid-speech-giving-game. So, in continuation ...<br>
 Sonali, you are a really sporting person. And I really wish I could be half the oblivious as you are, to certain things as you are, in a positive way. I really do. I still havenot been able to decode your brain that perfectly remembers each and every nitty-gritty of a subject, but fails to acknowledge the the obvious,(At times). It is amusing. Atleast, for me.LOL!<br>

 But yes, I do find your random, at the drop of a hat replies, verryyy funny. You are a wonderful person. I dont really think somebody else can lighten up the mood like you do, in such an unintenional way. <b>You really are the joey to the BADA GROUP.</b>    
Also, what I appreciate in you is your innate quality of being a doting daughter. Hindi mein bolun toh *Tumhare gharelupnta ne dil touch krlia hai* :)<br>
And not to forget your craftiness. I absolutely love the masterpiece my WE-4 is able to create. That reminds me, We-4 hasnot been active for a while. Time that we do it.<br>

  <p>
    So, I am not going to make it an <b>Infinite Scroll!!</b>.<br>
    Time That I rest my thoughts.<br>
    Stay Happy<br>
    Stay Crazy<br>
    Stay the Ghumukad you<br>
    Once Again Many Many Returns of the day<br>
    With lots of love and warm wishes.<br>
